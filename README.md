# FutterlisteNg
Another half-finished project of mine. Can be used to track (food) expenses acrorss a team/organization.
The idea was to replace our Excel File with a web application and to tryout Blazor.

I never got around to finish or properly test this project so you probably shouldn't use this thing to track expenses or otherwise your money goes brrrr down the drain.

Maybe in the future ;)
